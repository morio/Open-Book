# Open Book
OP book writing for the internet masses

This is an idea more that an license. 
You see it's beginnings here: https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/

But I take it from the days of Copyleft, a joke on Copyright, and the collaborative model of the open source movement.
People have been writing computer code like this since more than one person worked on a project. 

So the model is.... figure it out yourselves. It is your and your and all your book. I figure if I can find an author/lawyer we will get OP1. Until then, forums, Github.com, a shared google doc, are great places to start on the internet. Or go old school, mail pen and paper (youâ€™ll all get to use those cool Postal Stamps you've wanted to buy).

My first go is my [autobiography](https://morio.github.io/autobiography/) (hey why not).

Go forth and write merrily together or by yourself and share early.
